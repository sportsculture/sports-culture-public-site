# How Sports Culture is involved in the rivalry?

I ( McHughson, not Robot ) grew up in Ohio, went to a few OSU vs Michigan games and then 
attended to complete my undergrad degree.  
Joseph (my co-founder, also not a robot even though he codes as fast as one sometimes) moved his 
family to the beautiful city of Ann Arbor.   

## When did the school Rivalry Start

The rivalry started in 1897 and we ( the Buckeyes ) weren't much of a rival in the beginning, but
we've been doing pretty well in recent years.  

## What makes it fun

Here at Sports Culture, we love competition and keep it friendly, because a strong competitor makes us both better.
Even when emotions get high, we appreciate being able to enjoy the competition and it's all good after the fact, 
sans bragging rights.
